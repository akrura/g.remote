<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>g.remote</em>

<h3>The exec parameter syntax</h3>

<em>g.remote</em> provides an exec parameter which can be used as
a normal module option, e.g.:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.remote ... exec="g.region -p"
</pre></div>

The value of the parameter is used as a command which is executed
a remote server. The individual parameters are separated using Python
<em>shlex</em> library with default settings which is POSIX parsing rules.

<p>
For user convenience, two additional options are provided. First, user
can specify just the name of the module as the value of the parameter.
The options and flags for the module are then provided as additional
parameters following the exec parameter:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.remote ... exec=g.region -p
</pre></div>

Anything after the exec parameter is considered as parameters of the
module to run remotely. This option is partially bypassing the standard
GRASS command line parser mechanism and may not always work as expected.
The advantage is that the separation of individual parameters is given
by the command line and operation system.

<p>
The second option is using the same syntax as the grass command when
GRASS GIS session is started from command line:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.remote ... --exec g.region -p
</pre></div>

Similarly to the first option, everything after the <tt>--exec</tt>
is considered a command which will be executed and the GRASS parser
is not involved in parsing this part of the command line.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The module was tested only with servers running Linux and some code
relies heavily on UNIX or POSIX features on the server side.

<p>
If user needs to just upload the data or create a Location and Mapset,
user still needs to provide some command to run. It is actually
advantageous to provide some command like e.g.:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.list type=raster,vector
</pre></div>

In this way, the user receives feedback about what is in the remote
Mapset.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.remote user=jsmith server=example.com grassdata=grassdata \
    location=gremote mapset=test1 -l exec="g.region -p"
</pre></div>
